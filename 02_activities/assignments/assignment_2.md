# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
Good Data Visualization
Example: "The History of the NFL" Visualization on Tableau Public
This visualization is a timeline of the NFL's history, presented interactively with filters to explore key milestones, team performance, and championship outcomes. It employs consistent and visually appealing design, uses a logical structure, and includes interactivity that helps users dive deeper into specific details.

Why It's Good:
Clarity: The visualization balances text and visuals, ensuring that users can understand key points at a glance. Clear labels and legends are used.
Engagement: Interactive features allow users to tailor the view to their interests, such as selecting a specific team or period.
Best Practices: It avoids clutter, ensuring information is organized and emphasizing key trends effectively. The color palette and layout draw attention to critical insights without overwhelming the viewer

Bad Data Visualization
Example: "Visual Vocabulary" Chart Compilation
This project attempts to summarize various types of data visualization methods but presents all styles in a single, densely packed chart without adequate guidance for interpretation.

Why It's Bad:

Overload: By cramming numerous chart types into one view, the visualization overwhelms users, making it difficult to identify which style is appropriate for specific data types.
Lack of Context: It fails to explain when or why to use each visualization type, leaving users guessing about their application.
Ineffective Communication: The absence of clear titles or callouts to highlight examples diminishes its utility as an educational tool. Viewers are likely to become confused rather than informed


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
1. Segment the Information
Current Issue: The chart crams multiple visualization types into a single dense display.
Solution: Divide the chart into categories based on data relationships, such as comparison, distribution, trends, and proportions. Present each category on separate panels or slides to reduce clutter.
2. Provide Context and Guidance
Current Issue: No explanation of when or why to use a specific chart type.
Solution: Add brief annotations or tooltips for each chart type explaining:
Appropriate data characteristics.
Typical use cases and limitations. For example, "Bar charts: Best for categorical comparisons with a small number of categories."
3. Enhance Visual Hierarchy
Current Issue: All visualization types are given equal visual weight, making it difficult to identify key elements.
Solution: Use font size, color, or grouping to prioritize common or impactful charts. Highlight widely-used options (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) more prominently than niche types.
4. Introduce Interactivity
Current Issue: Static design limits user engagement.
Solution: Make it interactive by incorporating filters, dropdowns, or hoverable tooltips. Users could explore chart types dynamically, viewing additional details or real-world examples.
5. Simplify the Design
Current Issue: Overload of visuals without a clear focal point.
Solution: Reduce the number of chart examples displayed simultaneously. Use clean, minimalist layouts with ample white space to reduce cognitive load.
6. Add Real-World Examples
Current Issue: Lack of context about how charts work in practice.
Solution: Embed real-life examples of the charts in action. For instance, link a scatter plot to a case study showing its use in financial analysis.





      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
